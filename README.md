# 3D canvas

A 2D canvas game made with javascript to look like a 3-dimensional shooter. Your goal is to shoot the targets on the wall as fast as possible to refill your health bar, which depletes at a constant rate. As you progress through the game, the targets will disappear more quickly, so keep your aim sharp and your reflexes ready!
